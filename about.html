                        Plunger lift has become a widely accepted and economical artificial lift alternative, especially
                        in high-gas/liquid-ratio (GLR) gas and oil wells. Plunger lift uses a free piston that travels
                        up and down in the well’s tubing string. It minimizes liquid fallback and uses the well’s energy
                        more efficiently than does slug or bubble flow. As with other artificial lift methods, the
                        purpose of plunger lift is to remove liquids from the wellbore so that the well can be produced
                        at the lowest bottomhole pressures.</div>

                        In recent years, the advent of microprocessors and electronic controllers, the studies detailing
                        the importance of plunger seal and velocity, and an increased focus on gas production have led
                        to a much wider use and broader application of plunger lift. Microprocessors and electronic
                        controllers have increased the reliability of plunger lift. Earlier controllers were on/off
                        timers or pressure switches that needed frequent adjustment to deal with operating-condition
                        changes such as line pressures, plunger wear, variable production rates, and system upsets. This
                        frustrated many operators and caused failures, and thus limited plunger use.</div>

                        Whether in a gas well, oil well, or gas lift well, the mechanics of a plunger-lift system are
                        the same. The plunger, a length of steel, is dropped through the tubing to the bottom of the
                        well and allowed to travel back to the surface. It provides a piston-like interface between
                        liquids and gas in the wellbore and prevents liquid fallback—a part of the liquid load that
                        effectively is lost because it is left behind. Because the plunger provides a “seal” between the
                        liquid and the gas, a well’s own energy can be used to lift liquids out of the wellbore
                        efficiently.</div>

                        A plunger changes the rules for liquid removal. In a well without a plunger, gas velocity must
                        be high to remove liquids, but with a plunger, gas velocity can be very low. Thus, the plunger
                        system is economical because it needs minimal equipment and uses the well’s gas pressure as the
                        energy source. Used with low line pressures or compression, plunger lift can produce many types
                        of wells to depletion.

                        Success in plunger lift systems depends on proper candidate identification, proper well
                        installation, and the effectiveness of the operator. Candidate identification primarily consists
                        of choosing a well with the proper GLR and adequate well-buildup pressure. Makeup gas or
                        compression can be used to amend unmet GLR and buildup-pressure requirements. Proper well
                        installation is important. A plunger must travel freely from the bottom of the well to the top
                        and back to the bottom, carry well liquids, and produce gas with minimal restriction. Problems
                        with tubing, the wellhead, or well configuration can cause failure.</div>

                        Early in the life of a liquid-producing gas well or high-GLR oil well, rates and velocities
                        usually are high enough to keep the wellbore clear of liquids. At this point, liquids
                        typically are produced as a mist entrained in the gas stream. The high turbulence and velocity
                        of these gas rates provides an efficient lifting mechanism for the liquids and the well produces
                        at steady flow rates.</div>
